5 stars = 0.6%
4 stars = 6% (until the tenth pull: tenth pull = 100%)
every ten pull = at least 1 four star (99.4%)

75 pulls = starts to increase by 6.6% each pull until 90 pulls

let fiveStar = .006;
pulls = 0;

if num < 0.006 {

} else {
    if num > 0.006 and num < .066 + .006
}

if pulls >= 75 and pulls <= 90 {
    fiveStar += .066;
}
if pulls % 10 = 0 {
    fourStar = .994;
} else {
    fourStar = .06;
}

Math.random


50 50 => actually 50 50
between the limited and standard

four star always guranteed every ten pulls 

5 star can take four star place in 10 pull
100% four star next pull

MY RULES: at 5 pull, four star increase by 18.8% ; 50 50 for five star = 53 47

Pities = carry over in the same banner

On the standard banner = standard character get higher rates: 70 30

limited: get at 80
one limited five star
four random four star

weapon: get at 80
one five star weapon of the five star
random set of four star weapons

Standard: get at 90
standard characters/weapons



standard character: Jean (Anemo sword), Diluc (Pyro claymore), Mona (Hydro catalyst), Qiqi (Cryo sword), Keqing (Electro sword), Dehya (Pyro claymore), and Tighnari (Dendro bow)

standard weapon: Amos' Bow, Primordial Jade Winged Spear, Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds, Wolf's Gravestone, Aquila Favonia, Skyward Harp, Skyward Spine, Skyward Atlas, Skyward Pride, Skyward Blade

Idea: do all banners, limited only, limited + weapon, limited + standard, or standard
