5 stars = 0.6%
4 stars = 6% (until the tenth pull: tenth pull = 100%)
every ten pull = at least 1 four star

75 pulls = starts to increase by 6.6% each pull until 90 pulls
EXCEPT weapon = starts at 65 pulls

50 50 => actually 50 50
between the limited and standard

four star always guranteed every ten pulls (99.4%)
also 50 50 between random or rate up character/weapon
there are usually three rate ups => 50 split up so after 50 chosen 1/3 between each

5 star can take four star place in 10 pull
100% four star next pull

MY RULES: at 5 pull, four star increase by 18.8% ; 50 50 for five star = 53 47

For four star there is a 60 40 between character and weapon first before going to actual
Same for Standard Banner


limited: get at 80
one limited five star
four random four star

weapon: get at 80
one five star weapon of the five star
random set of four star weapons

Standard: get at 90
standard characters/weapons



standard character: Jean (Anemo sword), Diluc (Pyro claymore), Mona (Hydro catalyst), Qiqi (Cryo sword), Keqing (Electro sword), Dehya (Pyro claymore), and Tighnari (Dendro bow)

standard weapon: Amos' Bow, Primordial Jade Winged Spear, Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds, Wolf's Gravestone, Aquila Favonia, Skyward Harp, Skyward Spine, Skyward Atlas, Skyward Pride, Skyward Blade

Idea: do all banners, limited only, limited + weapon, limited + standard, or standard
